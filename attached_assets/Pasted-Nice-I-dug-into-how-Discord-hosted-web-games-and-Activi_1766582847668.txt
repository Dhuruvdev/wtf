Nice — I dug into how Discord-hosted web games and Activities work, what players actually love, and built a full game concept you can ship under the brand thats.wtf. I included concrete integration notes (Discord Activities / Embedded App SDK / Social SDK / Game SDK), the player loop, MVP tech stack, monetization & moderation ideas, and a short roadmap so you can start prototyping immediately.

1) Quick pitch (elevator)

thats.wtf — “Micro-madness: Voice + Reaction Party”
A fast, social voice-channel party game that mixes short asymmetric rounds (one “mission” player vs the rest) with microgames, live voice cues, and community-driven content. Launchable directly in Discord as an Activity (iframe) so players jump in from voice channels with zero installs. Great for casual game nights and server events.

2) Why this fits Discord right now

Discord Activities let you embed multiplayer social experiences (iframe) that users can launch straight from voice channels — low friction = high adoption. 

Social features (identity, invites, presence) are available via the Social SDK — useful for frictionless login and friend invites. 

Examples of successful Activities and party games on Discord (Sketch Heads, Poker Night, Chess in the Park) show players prefer short, voice-enabled, highly social games. 

Discord provides Rich Presence and Game SDK tooling if you want deeper integration (leaderboards, presence updates). 


3) Core game concept (the fun)

Name: thats.wtf — Micro-madness
Players: 4–12 (voice channel)
Session length: 5–12 minutes (best for repeated plays)
Round structure (3 phases):

1. Pick the WTF — a short prompt/mission chosen by the server or algorithm (e.g., “Convince us you’re an alien in 20s”, “Sing one-line of a made-up jingle”, “Lie about the meme and don’t get caught”).


2. Play the microgames — 3 rapid microgames (10–40s each). Microgames use voice reactions, quick web UI taps, or chat tokens: examples include Voice-Act (mimic an emotion), Quick Draw (draw on canvas, others guess), Emoji Relay (react chain), and Bluff Vote.


3. Vote & Reveal — players vote (UI buttons) for winner/most-convincing/hidden role; rewards distributed; next round.



Core tension: asymmetric roles + real-time social cues in voice (bluffs/smacktalk) create memorable interactions and hilarity — perfect for streaming/clip creation.

4) Why it’ll stick (retention & virality)

Low friction: one click to launch in voice channel via Activities → instant participation. 

Clip & share loop: rounds are short and produce funny moments users will clip to socials.

Community content: allow servers to submit custom “WTF prompts” and vote top prompts into rotation. Server creators can brand their prompt packs (monetizable).

Asymmetric play: rotating “star player” role gives variety and replayability.


5) Discord integration plan (practical)

Embedded App / Activities (iframe): host the game frontend as a secure web app and register as a Discord Activity so users can launch it from voice channels. Use the Embedded App SDK to handle lifecycle and identity. 

Social SDK: quick sign-in and friend invites without forcing a separate account. 

Optional Rich Presence/Game SDK: update presence, show “playing thats.wtf”, or attach session metadata for invites and match info. 

Bot fallback: provide a companion Discord bot for older clients or non-voice game modes — handles matchmaking, leaderboard posts, and premium unlocks.


6) Minimal Viable Product (MVP) — prioritize these

1. Single Activity iframe that launches in voice channels and supports 4 players. (Core loop only: Pick Mission → 2 microgames → vote) — must. 


2. Voice signal integration: capture basic voice activity (who’s speaking) to trigger certain microgames (no audio recording). Use voice activity indicators rather than raw audio capture to avoid privacy issues.


3. UI: small responsive canvas for microgames, emoji vote buttons, small scoreboard.


4. Server options: host per-server prompt packs and custom prompts.


5. Analytics & clip hook: easy button to export a 20s highlight clip (client-side) for social share.



7) Example microgames (fast list)

Voice-Act: given a phrase/emotion; star player must act using voice only; others press “guess” fast.

Emoji Relay: chain reactions: each player must respond with next emoji within 5s.

Bluff & Call: star makes a statement; players vote true/false; points for deceiver or callers.

Canvas Snap: 25s draw + instant guessing (like skribbl.io). (Browser canvas) 


8) Tech stack recommendation (web-first)

Frontend: React + TypeScript, minimal Tailwind (or your design system). Use websockets (Socket.io) for low-latency microgame sync.

Backend: Node (Fastify/Express) + Redis for session state and pub/sub; horizontally scale sessions.

Hosting: edge CDN + serverless for scale (Vercel/Cloudflare Pages for frontend, small fleet for real-time).

Discord integration: Embedded App SDK (Activity) + Social SDK, and a companion bot using discord.js or pycord for admin features. 


9) Monetization & growth

Free core with cosmetic packs (avatar frames, reaction sound packs).

Server Premium: paid prompt packs, custom server branding, private event mode, bigger rooms.

Sponsored prompt packs: collabs with creators/influencers for branded prompts.

Use a referral bonus (invite friend to join a session → earn a cosmetic).


10) Moderation & safety (must-haves)

No audio recording unless explicit user consent; prefer voice-activity metadata.

Report & block in-game options; server owners can blacklist prompts.

Rate limits and profanity filters for community prompts.

Auto-moderation for image uploads/drawings using safe-content APIs.


11) Roadmap (concrete 6–12 week plan)

Week 0–2: wireframes + MVP tech spike (Embedded App iframe + simple microgame engine).
Week 3–5: core microgames, multiplayer sync, voting; register Activity and test locally. 
Week 6–8: Social SDK sign-in, leaderboards, basic monetization hooks. 
Week 9–12: polish, analytics, server admin features, launch to selected communities / Discord App Directory submission.

12) Competitive edge & branding for thats.wtf

Brand voice: irreverent, meme-native, quick, and clipped. Name suits short viral clips and social sharing.

Differentiator: voice-first microgames + server-generated content — nobody owns the “best short voice party loop” inside Discord yet. Use “that’s.wtf moments” as the shareable clip branding.


13) Quick prototype checklist (what to build now)

Basic frontend with 1 microgame (Voice-Act) + vote UI.

Socket server to sync players and votes.

Embedded App registration and local Activity testing (follow Discord docs). 

Companion bot to announce sessions & post leaderboard.


14) Helpful links I used (for your devs)

Discord Social SDK (quick sign-in & sharing). 

Discord Game SDK / Rich Presence docs (optional deeper integration). 

Sample game integration repo (github sample).

If you want, I can now:

convert the MVP checklist into a step-by-step Trello-style task list, or

generate starter React code for the Voice-Act microgame + a simple Socket.io server (ready to paste into Replit), or

write the copy for your Discord App Directory listing & store/landing page.


Which one do you want first?
